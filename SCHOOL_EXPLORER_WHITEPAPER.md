## 🔥 The "Hype" Factor: Why This Module is a Game Changer

If implemented well, this module turns the ERP from a "boring management tool" into a **Revenue Generating Asset** for schools.

### 1. The "Verified Review" Revolution
*   **Problem:** Schools hate generic sites because random people (or competitors) leave fake 1-star reviews.
*   **Our Solution:** Only a parent **linked to a student in the ERP** can write a review.
*   **The Hype:** "The only place where 5 stars actually means 5 stars." Parents trust it more, Schools value it more.

### 2. Gamification & Leaderboards
*   Real-time rankings create a competitive environment.
*   Schools will strive to improve their **Infrastructure**, **Academics**, and **Sports** ratings to climb the leaderboard.
*   **Badge System:** Schools earn badges like *"Top Rated Academics 2025"* automatically based on data, not payments.

### 3. SEO Domination for Schools
*   Each school gets a **high-performance, SEO-optimized public profile** automatically generated from their ERP data.
*   Small schools without a website now have a premium web presence instantly.
